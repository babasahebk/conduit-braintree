## What this does

Add something about what the mechanics of this change are

## Why we did this

Who does it help? How does it help them?

## I'd like the reviews to pay special attention to:

My emotions, the callback, the DB, performance, correctness, etc

## The original feature connected to this bug fix is:

throw a link to a PR or JIRA here.

## We'll have to do this manual step

Run a rake task, edit the DB, ensure the front end is out first, etc

## Special rollback steps:

Are there unreversable migrations? Will we have to roll back the front end? Clear a cache?


## Overall, I feel this way about this code

Shame, pride, exasperation, glee, relief, exhaustion?
